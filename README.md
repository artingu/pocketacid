# Pocket Acid

Pocket Acid is a self-contained music studio designed for use with game
controllers and cheap, handheld Linux-based game consoles like the [R36S](https://handhelds.wiki/R36S_Handheld_Wiki).
It's designed for live use, with quick access to synthesizer parameters via
joysticks, muting using button combinations and pattern queuing.

The patterns, arrangement and parameters and so on are all contained in a
single file, which is automatically saved upon exit.

# Installation

If you are using Windows or ArkOS (or any 64-bit platform using PortMaster),
[get the latest release build here.](https://github.com/boomlinde/pocketacid/releases/latest)

To install on an ArkOS device, extract the `.portmaster.zip` archive to the
ports directory in the EASYROMS partition. The ports directory should now
contain the file `Pocket Acid.sh` and the directory `pocketacid`. Pocket Acid
will be available under the ports entry in the main menu on the next boot.

To install on Windows, simply extract the `.win64.zip` archive to the desired
location.

To build on Linux, build the port using zig 0.14.1 compiler. After you run the
`release.sh` script, that version of Zig will be available in prereqs/zig.

Then you can simply run:

    prereqs/zig/zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast

after which the executable will be available at `zig-out/bin/pocketacid`.

# Bassline synthesizer

The bassline synthesizer architecture is built on phase distortion, but is
designed to roughly emulate the sound and control of a classic, subtractive
bassline synthesizer. Unlike a typical phase distortion synthesizer, it
employs feedback phase modulation to optionally produce a harsher, distorted
tone. Unlike a classic bassline synthesizer, controlling the waveform and
"filter cutoff" are unified into a single control, called "timbre".

Parameters:

* **timbre**: controls the timbre of the synth. The closer to the center it
  is, the less overtones the sound will have. Above the center, the timbre
  tends more towards a square wave. Below the center, more towards a sawtooth
  wave.
* **env**: controls how great a portion of the timbre parameter is
  controlled by the timbre envelope.
* **res**: controls the "resonance" of the synth. The "resonance" is a
  sinewave synchronized to the body of the sound and windowed and
  attenuated in a way that corresponds to the level of the parameter.
  The frequency of the resonance is determined by the timbre and env
  parameters.
* **feedback**: controls the feedback phase modulation level. At low
  settings, there is no feedback and the sound predictably reflects
  the other parameter settings. At higher settings, the output of
  the synth is fed back via a unit delay to control the phase of
  both the body of the sound and the resonance wave, causing less
  predictable distortion.
* **decay**: controls the decay time of the timbre envelope.
* **accent**: controls the level of influence an accent in the
  sequencer will have on the timbre

The parameter settings are visible at the bottom of the arranger/pattern
sequencer page. Which parameters are shown (and edited by the joysticks)
can momentarily be toggled. If a bassline synth is muted, it will also be
indicated here using color.

# Drum machine

The drum machine is more simple, based on built-in recordings of drum
machines that can't be manipulated except to change the set of samples
used.

## Controls

Pocket Acid assumes a controller layout similar to that of a typical
Xbox/Playstation controller, with two sticks and four shoulder
buttons. The buttons are named as follows:

        L2                      L2
        L1                      L1

        up                       Y
    left  right  select start  X   B
       down                      A
               L3        R3

If your face buttons are not laid out like that, you can swap Y with X
and A with B using the "swap buttons" setting.

Globally, you can always control the bassline timbre and envelope using the
left stick for bassline 1 and right stick for bassline 2. You can hold L2 or
R2 to control other bassline parameters using the sticks (see below).

The buttons are also mapped to the computer keyboard buttons:

| Keyboard key | Controller button |
| ------------ | ----------------- |
| return       | start             |
| tab          | select            |
| z            | A                 |
| x            | B                 |
| a            | X                 |
| s            | Y                 |
| q            | L1                |
| w            | R1                |
| 1            | L2                |
| 2            | R2                |

Since there are no joysticks on the keyboard, these don't represent
a full set of controls, but can for example be used while sequencing.

Some controls apply globally across the program:

| Button(s)   | Effect                                              |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- |

| L1+B        | Toggle mute of hihat and cymbal                     |
| L1+A        | Toggle mute of toms                                 |
| L1+R1       | Toggle mute of rimshot and clap                     |
| L1+L2       | Toggle mute of bassline 1                           |
| L1+R2       | Toggle mute of bassline 2                           |
| L2          | Momentarily control bassline resonance and feedback |
| R2          | Momentarily control bassline decay and accent       |

Others are specific to the different sections of the programs described below

## Sections

Pocket Acid is divided into several sections which you can normally move
between using the select and R1 buttons:

* **Arranger**: used for arranging patterns into loops or songs
* **Bassline pattern sequencer**: used to compose bassline patterns
* **Drum machine pattern sequencer**: used to compose drum machine patterns
* **Mixer**: used to control levels, panning, effect send and ducking
* **Settings**: used to control various parameters not mapped to the
  joysticks, as well as global settings for the application.

The sections are described in greater detail below.

### Arranger

    00......
    01......
    02010201≡
    03010202
    01......

The arranger contains sequences of patterns for each of the first bassline,
second bassline and drum sequencers, arranged in columns in that order.
Lumps of consecutive pattern indices separated by empty rows are called
sections.

When you start playback inside a section and the playhead reaches the end of
the section, the playhead loops back to where you started playback. The only
exception to this is if you have queued a row, in which case the playhead
will instead jump to the queued row.

The playhead moves individually for each column, which is important to
consider if you are using odd pattern lengths.

You can attach a snapshot to each row in the arranger. If there is a snapshot
at a given row, it will be visible as a ≡ symbol to the right of the arranger
columns.

A snapshot contains all the settings and controls for the synthesizers, drum
machine and mixer, and also tempo.

When the drum sequencer playhead starts playing a row with a snapshot on it,
the snapshot will be loaded. If this happens mid-playback, the tempo won't
be changed, disregarding the tempo setting in the snapshot.

The sequencer will keep track of which snapshot was last loaded while
playing, so it won't reload the same snapshot twice in a row. This way,
you can for example use snapshots as an initial set of settings for a
section.  You can always load snapshots manually as well.

If the arranger cursor hovers over a pattern number, the respective
pattern sequencer will be shown to the right. You can switch to this
to edit the pattern.

The bassline sequencer is of a classic design with a sequence of pitches
and gates, with parallel sequences of octave, slide and accent modifiers.
The first 13 rows represent pitch and gate as a piano roll, while the next
four rows represent the modifiers.

Unlike the classic design, each pattern has its own base pitch, meaning the
pitch at which the octave starts.

| Symbol | Effect                          |
| ------ | ------------------------------- |
| +      | Play the pitch an octave higher |

an effect (ac, ··).

If drum instruments are muted (via the global button combinations), it will be
indicated using color in the drum pattern sequencer instrument name column.

Instruments:

* bd: bass drum
* sd: snare drum
* ch: closed hi-hat
* oh: open hi-hat
* lt: low tom
* ht: high tom
* cy: cymbal
* rs: rimshot
* cp: hand clap

Effects:

* ac: accent; play all instruments triggered on the same step louder
* ··: retrigger; play all the instruments triggered on the same step twice

The bassline synthesizers' and drum machine's output signals are all mixed
together in the mixer. The mixer is also connected to a stereo feedback
delay as a send effect, and each channel can optionally be attenuated by
an envelope following the bass drum (referred to as "ducking" below).
